CREATING MESSAGES AND SERVICES

msg: msg files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message
inside the text files, there are just variable declarations in each line
the variables can have the following formats:
int8, int16, int32, int64 (plus uint*)
float32, float64
string
time, duration
other msg files
variable-length array[] and fixed-length array[C]
header


srv: an srv file describes a service. It is composed of two parts: a request and a response.
the files are similar to msg files, except they contain two parts: request and response

ex:
int64 A  -> request part
int64 B
--- 	 -> response part
int64 Sum

CREATING MESSAGES:

# create a variable num inside message Num
echo "int64 num" > msg/Num.msg
