Pyff has moved from SVN to GIT!
===============================

The old googlecode repository is no longer in use. The new repository is

  http://github.com/bbci/pyff

You can still use SVN in read-only mode with the git repository if you must,
but I encourage you to use git instead!

How to use SVN with the git repository:
=======================================

Github also support limited support for accessing the GIT repository with SVN:

  https://github.com/blog/966-improved-subversion-client-support

Do the initial checkout:

  svn checkout https://github.com/bbci/pyff/trunk pyff

Basic work cycle:

  # update your repository
  svn update

  # your actual work..
  <edit files>
  svn add
  svn delete
  svn copy
  svn move

  # examine your changes
  svn status
  svn diff
  svn revert

  # create a patch and send it to me
  svn diff > my-changes.patch

The last step is necessary since you cannot commit changes into the git
repository. So you collect all the changes in one file and send it to me.
